# Vehicle_App

***## •	Implement the Vehicle hierarchy as described above. 
•	Create instances of Car, Motorcycle, and Truck with appropriate data. 
Example data: Car(vehicleId: 1, make: "Toyota", model: "Camry", fuelEfficiency: 15.0f, numDoors: 4, isAutomatic: true), Motorcycle(vehicleId: 2, make: "Yamaha", model: "R1", fuelEfficiency: 20.0f, engineCC: 1000, isSportBike: true), and Truck(vehicleId: 3, make: "Ford", model: "F-150", fuelEfficiency: 8.0f, cargoCapacity: 5.0f, isHeavyDuty: true) 
•	Calculate and display fuel consumption for each vehicle for a given distance. 
 distance = 150.0f; // for testing fuel consumption 
•	Consider additional factors like cargo weight and vehicle type to refine fuel consumption calculations.***
